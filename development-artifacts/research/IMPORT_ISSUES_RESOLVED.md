# Import Issues Resolution Summary

## ✅ Successfully Resolved Import Problems

### 📋 Issues Fixed:

1. **`gpu_detector` import resolution**

   - Created fallback `gpu_detector.py` module
   - Implements basic GPU detection using PyTorch and DirectML
   - Provides consistent API for GPU discovery

2. **`tensorflow_directml` optional import handling**

   - Added proper try/catch blocks with type hints
   - Graceful fallback when DirectML not available
   - Clear error messages for missing dependencies

3. **Code refactoring and cleanup**

   - Removed massive string literal containing executable code
   - Extracted `gpu_device_helpers.py` as proper Python module
   - Fixed indentation and syntax issues throughout
   - Improved error handling and logging

4. **Data structure consistency**
   - Fixed GPU detection return format handling
   - Added robust type checking for dictionary vs list returns
   - Proper vendor filtering with safety checks

### 📁 Files Created/Modified:

1. **`gpu_detector.py`** (New)

   - Fallback GPU detection module
   - Supports both NVIDIA (CUDA) and AMD (DirectML)
   - Consistent API with comprehensive error handling

2. **`gpu_device_helpers.py`** (Refactored)

   - Extracted from string literal to proper module
   - Advanced device selection logic
   - Environment compatibility checking

3. **`mixed_gpu_environment_manager.py`** (Fixed)

   - Resolved all import issues
   - Improved error handling
   - Fixed syntax and indentation problems

4. **`test_gpu_integration.py`** (New)
   - Comprehensive integration testing
   - Validates all modules work together
   - Clear pass/fail reporting

### 🎯 Test Results:

```
🧪 GPU Environment Integration Test
==================================================
GPU Detection................. ✅ PASS
Device Helpers................ ✅ PASS
Mixed GPU Manager............. ✅ PASS

Total: 3/3 tests passed
🎉 All import issues resolved! GPU environment is ready.
```

### 🔧 Key Improvements:

- **Better maintainability**: Code now in proper Python files with IDE support
- **Robust error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing dependencies
- **Separation of concerns**: GPU detection, device selection, and environment management are now distinct modules
- **Type safety**: Added proper type hints and data structure validation
- **Testing**: Comprehensive integration tests ensure everything works together

### 🚀 Ready for Production:

The GPU environment manager is now ready for production use with:

- ✅ All critical import errors resolved
- ✅ Proper fallback mechanisms in place
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Integration testing validated
- ✅ Clean, maintainable code structure
